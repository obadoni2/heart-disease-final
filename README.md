# Heart Disease Prediction System

## Overview
The Heart Disease Prediction System is a web application developed using Python, Flask, MySQL, Apache server, and logistic regression with the Random Forest algorithm. The system aims to predict the likelihood of a patient having heart disease based on various input features. It provides different user roles, including admin, doctor, and patient, each with specific functionalities and access levels. The system allows real-time data feeding, session management, and accurate predictions using a trained model with a high accuracy rate of 97%.

## Key Features
- User Roles: The system provides three user roles - admin, doctor, and patient - each with their specific functionalities and access levels.
- Admin Login: The admin has privileged access to manage users, data, and system settings.
- Doctor Login: Doctors can view patient details, medical records, and perform predictions.
- Patient Login: Patients can access their medical records, view predictions, and manage their profile.
- Real-time Data Feeding: The system allows users to input real-time data for prediction, ensuring up-to-date information.
- Session Management: Users' sessions are managed securely, providing a smooth and reliable experience.
- Heart Disease Prediction: The system uses logistic regression with the Random Forest algorithm to predict the likelihood of a patient having heart disease.
- High Accuracy: The trained model achieves an impressive accuracy rate of 97% in predicting heart disease.
- Database Integration: The system utilizes MySQL to store and manage user information, medical records, and prediction results.
- Apache Server: The application is deployed on an Apache server for robust and scalable performance.



## Technologies Used
- Python: The primary programming language used for developing the Heart Disease Prediction System.
- Flask: A web framework used for building the application and handling routing and request handling.
- MySQL: A relational database management system used for storing and managing user data, medical records, and prediction results.
- Apache Server: The application is deployed on an Apache server for hosting and serving the web application.
- Logistic Regression: A machine learning algorithm used for training the model to predict heart disease.
- Random Forest: An ensemble learning algorithm utilized with logistic regression to enhance the accuracy of heart disease prediction.
